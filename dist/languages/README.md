This directory stores translation patches (TS files) for atlantis Qt frontend. This directory is linked with [atlantis project on transifex](https://www.transifex.com/atlantis-emulator/atlantis), so you can update the translation by executing `tx pull -t -a`. If you want to contribute to the translation, please go the transifex link and submit your translation there. This directory on the main repo will be synchronized with transifex periodically.

Do not directly open PRs on github to modify the translation.
